# Code for Directional Optimism for Safe Linear Bandits

This the code submitted alongside the paper "Directional Optimism for Safe Linear Bandits".

The results for Figure 2a are generated with the file slb_short.py and the results for Figure 2b are generated with the file slb_long.py.
These codes use the file safe_linear_bandit.py and then saves the results.
The plots can then be generated with the notebook plot_data.ipynb.
